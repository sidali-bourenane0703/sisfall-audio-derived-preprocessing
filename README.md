# Audio Preprocessing and Augmentation for SisFall Audio Dataset

This repository provides **scripts and derived audio data** for preprocessing and augmentation from the dataset:

It enables **reproducible pipelines** for generating mel-spectrogram features used in our paper:

## Preprocessing and Augmentation Pipeline

### 1. Audio Data Augmentation
To address the limited size of the SisFall dataset, we applied augmentation to increase both quantity and diversity of audio samples. The following techniques were applied to the original fall and non-fall audio files:

- **AddGaussianNoise**: amplitude range 0.001â€“0.015, probability 0.5  
- **TimeStretch**: rate 0.8â€“1.2, probability 0.5  
- **PitchShift**: shift âˆ’4 to +4 semitones, probability 0.5  

### 2. Audio Preprocessing
- **Trimming**: Each sample is trimmed to approximately 3 seconds, centering on the most energetic segment to capture the essential *fall* noise.  
- **Normalization**: Each sample is normalized by dividing by its maximum absolute value to ensure consistent amplitude.  
- **No additional preprocessing** (e.g., denoising) was applied.  

### 3. Feature Extraction
- From the preprocessed audio, **mel-spectrograms** are extracted (`n_mels=128` by default).  
- Features can be expanded to 3-channel (RGB-like) inputs for CNN compatibility.
